    question: "What is the RCT Ecosystem?",
    answer: "RCT is a constitutional AI operating system built by a solo developer in Bangkok, Thailand — 62 microservices, 41 algorithms, 7 HexaCore AI models, and 4,849 automated tests passing at 0 failures. It combines the FDIA equation (F=D^I×A), JITNA Protocol (RFC-001), 10-layer architecture, and 7 genome subsystems.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the JITNA Protocol work?",
    answer: "JITNA (Just-In-Time Nodal Assembly) operates in 5 phases: Intent Capture → Data Enrichment → Delta Synthesis → Architect Review → Response Delivery, each with quality gates. It is published as RFC-001 v2.0 under Apache 2.0 license and is designed as the open communication standard for multi-LLM AI agents.",
  },
  {
    question: "What infrastructure does RCT require?",
    answer: "RCT runs on a 62-microservice architecture with PostgreSQL, Redis, and optional Ollama for local LLM inference, validated by 4,849 passing tests across 8 test levels. It scales from Docker Compose (33 containers) to Kubernetes (57 resources with HPA, PDB, NetworkPolicy, ArgoCD).",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the RCT HexaCore 7-model architecture?",
    answer: "HexaCore is the 7-model AI infrastructure of the RCT Ecosystem: 3 Western LLMs + 3 Eastern LLMs + 1 Thai regional model (Typhoon v2). All 7 models run in parallel for critical queries through the HexaCore Consensus mechanism, which requires constitutional agreement thresholds (50–100% depending on tier) before releasing output. This delivers 3.74x cost reduction vs single-model deployments while reducing hallucination to 0.3%.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does SignedAI reduce hallucination to 0.3%?",
    answer: "SignedAI routes each critical query through 4–8 models simultaneously and applies a constitutional consensus threshold: Tier 4 requires 50% agreement, Tier 6 requires 67%, Tier 8 requires 75%, and Tier S (sovereign) requires 100%. If consensus is not reached, the query is escalated rather than releasing an unverified output. The industry average hallucination rate is 12–15%; RCT achieves 0.3% through this multi-LLM verification layer.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Delta Engine's 74% compression capability?",
    answer: "The Delta Engine is RCT's memory compression system that stores only incremental state changes (deltas) rather than full state snapshots. It achieves an average of 74% lossless compression, enabling warm recall in under 50ms vs a full cold-start LLM call of 3–5 seconds. Sub-1ms delta reconstruction means the performance overhead is negligible. This is how RCT maintains deep context across long sessions without proportional memory cost.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the Circuit Breaker Pattern work in AI pipelines?",
    answer: "The Circuit Breaker Pattern in AI systems has three states: CLOSED (normal operation — requests flow through), OPEN (failure threshold exceeded — requests are blocked and fallback providers are used), and HALF-OPEN (test mode — limited traffic allowed to check recovery). In the RCT Platform, the FDIA score acts as the trip signal: when F drops below 0.7, the breaker opens. RFC-006 Fault Isolation implements this across all 62 microservices, enabling 7 fallback LLM providers with automatic switching. This is why the RCT Platform maintains 99.9% uptime SLA even when individual model providers experience outages.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is Intent Farming and how does it reduce AI costs over time?",
    answer: "Intent Farming is the systematic practice of accumulating and enriching AI context over time, converting one-shot queries into progressively smarter sessions. Instead of starting cold each session, the RCTDB memory layer preserves intent history across 8 dimensions. The Delta Engine compresses this context by 74%, enabling warm recall in under 50ms. Over time, the percentage of queries served from warm cache increases — reducing LLM calls, cutting costs, and improving response quality through compounding context. The RCT Platform's warm recall rate improves by approximately 3–5% per week of operation.",
